This is a fork of https://github.com/ColorCookie-dev/porsmo that adds nix packaging and more importantly changes name to fix great missed opportunity that is 'pomodorust'.

# Porsmo
A rust program for pomodoro, timer, stopwatch - all in one.

# Project Goal
- Personal project
- All in one with good accuracy
  - Timer
  - Stopwatch
  - Pomodoro

# Roadmap
## Some info
- The Project is close to done
- i.e. It is close to how I wanted it to be
- New features will be added and bug fixes will be done
- however not as urgently
## In immediate future
- [X] Add direct time input
- [X] Add short and long command for subcommand
- [X] Add pomodoro feature
  - [X] Break timer
  - [X] Work timer
  - [X] Sessions (rounds of 4 block)
  - [X] Stopwatch after the end of a mode to show exceeding time
- [X] Stopwatch after the end of timer to show exceeding time
- Some more refactoring
  - [X] Refactoring of ui modules
## Someday
- [ ] Tracking
  - [ ] Tracking pomodoro sessions and resume feature
  - [ ] Tracking timer data in a file
- [ ] reading config for pomodoro timers in a file
## I'll think about it
- Alarm (works like timer, but accepts absolute time rather than a period of time)
- Stopwatch
- Server and GUI client or inbuilt gui
